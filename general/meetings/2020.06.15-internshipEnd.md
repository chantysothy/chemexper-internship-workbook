- install mqtt broker and GUI instance on power nuc (-> issue for Luc)
    - how to protect and MQTT broker?? with public/private key -> [issue](https://github.com/Hackuarium/mqtt/issues/1)

    - there is no way of securing only part of the nodes, but you can set one username/password for all the dashboard

- find IP address of raspi and enable ssh
- how to auto-boot on a web page in full screen on Raspberry pi
- dockerize the bioreactor GUI
    - work in progress
    - [bioreactor-docker](https://github.com/Hackuarium/bioreactor-docker)
    - still to do:
        - check all packages versions and modify dockerfile
    
## Things still to do

- PlatformIO: can we use it for Arduino programming?
  - migrate bioreactor firmware to PlatformIO
- video of the bioreactor GUI -> how to use it and how it is programmed
