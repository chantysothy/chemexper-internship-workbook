## People

Luc, OcÃ©ane


## Things done

- enhance charts refresh rate
- finish function to convert parameters in `legoino-util`
- check for a better charts library
- install mqtt broker and GUI instance on power nuc (-> issue for Luc)
- find a way to make some tabs in nodered inaccessible to people without the rights -> consultation view
    - there is no way of securing only part of the nodes, but you can set one username/password for all the dashboard
    - it is not possible to have multiple users on the dashboard
    - we will rather go in the direction of creating multiple node-red instances hosted on docker
    - the security issues might be solved when we work on the security of the MQTT broker
- find IP address of raspi and enable ssh

## Things still to do

- how to auto-boot on a web page in full screen on Raspberry pi
- how to protect and MQTT broker?? with public/private key
- PlatformIO: can we use it for Arduino programming?
  - migrate bioreactor firmware to PlatformIO
- dockerize the bioreactor GUI
- video of the bioreactor GUI -> how to use it and how it is programmed
