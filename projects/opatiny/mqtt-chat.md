# mqtt-chat

[Home](../../README.md) | [Projects TOC](../projects.md)

Link: [https://github.com/opatiny/mqtt-test](https://github.com/opatiny/mqtt-test)

## Goal

Publish MQTT messages and subscribe to topics from Node.js. There must be a broker running on your computer. The project allows you to chat between two terminals.

## Context

We need to understand how to publish messages and subscribe to some topics to be able to make the serial to mqtt driver for the bioreactor.

## Packages used

- `readline`: to read/write to the console
- `mqtt`: node library implementing mqtt
- `chalk`: to have colours in the terminal output
