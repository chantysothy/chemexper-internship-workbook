# React

## A React exercise

I have followed a tutorial to start getting used to React, the resulting code is in its own repository: [https://github.com/opatiny/react-exercise](https://github.com/opatiny/react-exercise).

## Context

React is a library that was created and is maintained by FaceBook. It allows to make responsive, mobile-friendly GUIs. Each thing on the webpage / interface is inside of an independent components.

## Create a new React app

```bash
npx create-react-app .
```

## Run the server

```bash
npm start
```

## Components

Standard syntax: components' names should have an uppercase first letter.

## VScode plugins

To create components more easily: `ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets`

To create a new component:
- create new file.js
- in it, type `rce+tab`


## Vocabulary

- DOM: Document Object Model -> the hole HTML
- jsx: React files extension
